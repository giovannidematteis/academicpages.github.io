title: "Large deviations and extreme events"
excerpt: "During my PhD I have developed a method based on large deviation theory and numerical optimization
in order to explain the formation of oceanic rogue waves. The resulting method for extreme events that we have formalized paves the way for
applications of large deviation theory in wave systems and in generic deterministic systems supplemented with random initial
conditions and/or parameters. This project resulted in publications in PNAS and PRX, and was featured
in popular science venues such as Scientific American, Quanta Magazine and the Physics magazine of the APS. <br/><img src='/images/image4.PNG'  style='width:600px;'>"
