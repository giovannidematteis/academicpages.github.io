title: "Wave Turbulence Theory derivations"
excerpt: "TThe field has been devoted increasing
attention in the past fiew years in the effort to prove rigorously the validity of the wave kinetic equation, which describes the
energy transfers between different scales in wave systems, via nonlinear resonant interaction. Since my MSc thesis, I have worked on derivations in wave kinetic theory
using diagrammatic techniques, obtaining original results on the preservation of chaos for four-wave systems. <br/><img src='/images/image3.PNG'>"
