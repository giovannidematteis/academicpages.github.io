title: "Energy fluxes in the oceanic internal wave field"
excerpt: "The rate of diapycnal mixing, largely due to internal-wave
breaking, is a key ingredient to understanding upwelling and horizontal circulation in the ocean. We work on deriving a first-principles
quantification of the downscale energy flux in the internal wave field, with the aim of providing a solid theoretical background to 
the finescale parameterizations that are used to include the effects of internal waves in the Global Circulation Models. <br/><img src='/images/image1.png'>"
