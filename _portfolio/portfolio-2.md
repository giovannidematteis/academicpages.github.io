title: "Thermal transport in particle lattices"
excerpt: "The theory of interacting waves finds ubiquitous application in nature, from the planetary
scales down to the scales of a millimeter-long carbon nanotube, where thermal conduction is due to interactions of reticular oscillations 
known as phonons. I have conducted recent investigations that are shedding new light on the anomalous thermal conduction
properties of low-dimensional particle lattices. <br/><center><img src='/images/image2.PNG' style='width:500px;'></center>"
