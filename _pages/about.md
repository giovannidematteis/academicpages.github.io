I am a Postdoc Research Associate in the group of Prof. [Yuri Lvov](http://wave.math.rpi.edu/) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Department of Mathematical Sciences, under the funding of ONR grant N00014-643 17-1-2852.

Check out our exciting latest results on the energy fluxes in the oceanic internal-wave band, published in the [Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06717.pdf) and under review in the [Journal of Physical Oceanography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02572.pdf)!

I obtained a BSc in Physics and a MSs in Physics of Complex Systems from Universita' di Torino (Italy) in 2013 and 2015 and a PhD in Applied Mathematics jointly from Politecnico di Torino and Universita' di Torino in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. [Lamberto Rondoni](http://calvino.polito.it/~rondoni/) and Prof. [Eric Vanden-Eijnden](https://wp.nyu.edu/courantinstituteofmathematicalsciences-eve2/). During my PhD, I spent 18 months at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, as a visiting PhD student.

I develop methods to investigate energy transport in physical systems supporting random wave fields, as well as the formation of extreme coherent events in these systems, with particular attention to problems of physical oceanography. My research draws from concepts from statistical physics, turbulence, probability, optimization, and related fields, combining theory with numerical simulations and first-hand analysis of observations. I work in close collaboration with experimental groups (e.g. [Kurt Polzin](https://web.whoi.edu/polzin/), [Miguel Onorato](http://personalpages.to.infn.it/~onorato/Home.html), [Arnaud Le Boyer](http://www.mod.ucsd.edu/arnaud-le-boyer)) and, as much as possible, my efforts spark from and are tested against analysis of real-world data.
